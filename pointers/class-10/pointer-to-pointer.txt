Pointer to pointers:
-----------------------
In c Pointer that point to other pointers, and these in turn point to data is known as Pointer to Pointer.

eg:
//pointer to pointer example
#include<stdio.h>
void main(){
    //local decalaration
    int* num1;
    int* num2;
    int num3;

    //statement
    num3 = 10;
    num1 = &num2;
    num2 = &num3;

    printf("The value of num1: %3d",num1);
    printf("the value of num2: %3d",num2);
    printf("The value of num3: %3d",num3);
    
}


//write a program where companyNumber points to accountNumber and accountNumber in turn points to salary 
and salary stores 50000 to print all the three varialbes
