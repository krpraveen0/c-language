Static Memory Allocation
--------------------------
For static Memory allocation we should ensure that the declaration and definition of Memory to be used is fully specified in the 
source program.
Which means number of bytes reserved cannot be changed during the run time.
Till now we have using static Memory allocation only.

Dynamic memory allocation
----------------------------
In dynamic memory allocation we use predefined functions to allocate and release memory for data while the 
program is running.
It effectively postpones the data declaration, to run time.

Memory Allocation functions:
----------------------------------
Majorly in C there are four memory management functions are used with dynamic memory.
1. malloc()
2. calloc()
3. realloc()
4. free()

The first three functions(malloc, calloc & realloc) are used for memory allocation.
The last function (free()) is used to return the memory when it is no longer needed.
All those memory management functions are found in the standard library file(stdlib.h).

1. malloc() [block memory allocation]:
----------------
The malloc() function allocates a block of memory that contains the number of bytes specified in its
parameter.
It returns a void pointer to the first byte of the allocated memory.
The allocated memory is not initialized.
