In a large program to process the arrays we should be able to pass those arrays to functions.
In that process we can pass 1D array to functions in two ways:
    1.) passing individual element.
    2.) passing whole array at a time.

1.) passing individual element.
-----------------------------------
    a) passing data values:
    -----------------------
    We can pass data values(that is individual array elements) just like we pass any data value.
    As long as the array element type matches the functions parameter type, it can be passed.
    The called function cannot tell wether the value it receives comes from an array, variable or an expressions.

    b) Passing Address:
    ----------------
    To pass an array elements address, we prefix the address operator to the element indexed reference.

    eg: To pass the address of arr[3], we use &arr[3].

    note: passing an address of an array element requires two chnages in the called function.
    First change:  
                1.) it must declare that it is receiving an address.
                2.) it must use the indirection operator(*)

Q. Write a program to reverse an input string given by the user.
Q. Write a program to check if the given string is palindrome or not. (eg: eye, malyalam etc)
