Parameter Passing technique:
---------------------------------
calling function -- > the function in which we call some other functions is known as calling function.
called function --> The function which is called inside another function is known as called function.

Paramter passing is a mechanism for communication of data and information between the calling function
and the called function.
C supports following types of parameter passing schemes:
1. Call by Value.
2. Call by address.

1. Call by Value:
-------------------
When the arguments are passed by value, the actual arguments in the calling function are 
copied into corresponding formal arguments of the called function.
In this way of parameter passing if we make any changes in the formal parameter of called function, then 
it will not effect on the values of actual arguments in calling function.

1. Call by address:
-------------------
When the arguments are passed by address, the address of the actual arguments in the calling function are copied
into formal arguments of the called function.
In this technique changes made to the formal arguments of the called function have effect on the values of 
the actual arguments in the calling function.
In this method we use pointer concept.
IN this technique of parmater passing the formal parameters must be declared as pointers.



//write a program to store address of a variable and change its value by using the concept of pointer.
//write a program which stores address of two variables and store those variables and perform addtion 
if first number is greater than the second number otherwise perform substraction.
