A null pointer is a special pointer value that points nowhere.
The most straight forward way to get a null pointer in the program is by using the predefined constant NULL,
which is defined by serveral header libraries of C such as stdio.h, stdlib.h, string.h etc.

Initializing a pointer to NULL:
----------------------------------------------
int* ip = NULL;

or 
int* ip = 0;
