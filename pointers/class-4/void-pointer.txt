Pointers defined to be of specific data type cannot hold the address of any other type of variable.
The pointers which doesn't have any data type associated with them ie can contain the address of 
any type of variable(int,char,float etc). is known as Void pointer.

Pointers to Void cannot be directly dereferenced like other pointer variables by using the indirection operator(*).
It must be suitably typecast to the required data type.
How we can type cast a void pointer?
A void pointer may be typecasted by preceding its name with relevant data type followed by an asterisk,
both of which must be enclosed within a pair of paranthesis.
