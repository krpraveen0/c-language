1.) Understanding Memory Address.
------------------------------------
The memory of a computer is made up of bytes arranged in a sequential manner.
Each byte has an index number, which is called as address of that byte.
So the address of these bytes starts from zero and the address last byte is one less than the size of the memory.
It is very necessary to declare a Variable before using it,since compiler has to reserve space for it.
For example:
        int  num = 2;
    
In the above statement is executed in a c program, the following tasks are done by the compiler:
1.) Allocates a memory location.
2.) The name 'num' assigned to the allocated memory location.
3.) The value 2 is stored into the memory.

memory layout of the memory elements of a C program:
---------------------------------------------------------

memory section name                                                                    Description

1.) Text(or the code segment)        This is the area of memory that contains the machine instructions
                                     corresponding to the compiled program.
                                     this area is READ ONLY and shared by a multiple instaces of running program.
                                
2.) Data                             This area in the memory image of a running program contains storage for
                                     initialized global variables.
                                     this area is separate for Each running instances of program.

3.) BSS                              This is the memory area that contains storage for uninitialized global variables.
                                     It is also separate for each running instaces of a program.

4.) Stack                            This memory area contains storage for automatic (local) variables in the program.
                                     It also stores context-specific information before a Function call.
                                     e.g the value of the instruction pointer(program counter) registers before a Function
                                     call is made.

5.) Heap                             This memory region is reserved for dynamically allocating memory for 
                                     variables at run-time.
                                     Dynamic memory allocation is done by using the malloc and calloc functions.

6.) Shared libraries                 This region contains the executable image of shared libraries being used by the program.



2.) pointer OPerators:
---------------------
There are two pointer operator:
    i) Address of operator(&).
    ii) Value at Address operator(*).

i) Address of operator(&):
-------------------------------
It returns the address of the memory location alloted to a specified variable.

Syntax: & variable-name
example : &num // this gives the address of the memory location of variable num 

ii) Value at Address operator(*):
------------------------------------
It returns the value stored inside the memory location at the specified address.
It is also called as 'indirection' operator.

Syntax:  * MemoryLocation-address
example: *(&num).
