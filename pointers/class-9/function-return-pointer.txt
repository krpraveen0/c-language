Functions returning Pointers:
------------------------------------

Some function returns a pointer also.
when a pointer is returned from a function, it must point to data in the calling function or in the global variable.
let us consider a program in which a pointer would point an integer variable, whichever will be larger between 
two variables through a function which returns the address of the larger variable.
