extern
-------
    scope: File Scope.
    Extent(lifetime): Static lifetime
    Linkage : external Linkage.
    Storage Space: Primary Memory(RAM)
    Initial value: Zero.


Sometimes program may be very large in syntax which can be broken up into smaller programs
After compiling these each program file can be joined together to form the large program.

These small program modules that combine together may need some variable that can be used by all of them.

In c such a provision can be made by specifying these variables, accessible to all the small program modulesas accessible
as an external storage class variable(extern keyword).

these variables are global to all the small program modules that are formed as separate files.
the keyword for declaring such global variables is extern.

Such global variables are declared like any other variable in one of the program modules while the declaration
of these variables are preceded with the keyword extern in all other combining program modules.

The program modules may also be functions or blocks.
