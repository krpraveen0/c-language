register
--------------
Scope: Block Scope(Local Scope)
Extent(lifetime): Automatic lifetime.
Linkage: Internal Linkage
Storage Space: CPU registers
Initial Value: Unpredictable value or garbage value.

register is a keyword, used to decalre register variables.
register Storage class is same as auto class with only difference of storage space.
Memory locations on the microprocessor chip are known as register.

Storage and retrieval of data from a register can be done by a program much faster.

The normal place of storing the value of a variable is the main memory (RAM).but the storage specifier register 
qualifies a variable, so that the contents of the variables defined is stored in one of the register of the CPU.

Register storage can be specified only to local variables not to global variables.

Register variables are ideal for use where there is a repeated use of that variables such as loop.

If there are not enough registers available, then the c compiler will automatically ignore the register data type
and it keeps them in the main memory.
