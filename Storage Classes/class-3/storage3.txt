static
------------
static is a keyword used to define the storage class as static.
The use of static storage class specifier makes a variable a permanent variable within a specified region.

Two kinds of variables are allowed to be specified as static variable.
    1.) static variable with block scope.
    2.) static variable with file scope.

1.) static variable with block scope:
---------------------------------------
    Scope : block Scope.
    Extent(lifetime): static lifetime.
    Linkage: Internal Linkage.
    Storage Space: Main Memory.
    Initial value: Zero.


For static variable with block scope a permanent storage location is alloted in the primary Memory.
The computer allocates the storage for this variable only once.

This variable is usable within function or blocks where it is declared and preserves its previous value
held by it between the function calls.

In the case of static variable the contents of the variable will be retained throughtout the program.
In absence of any initialization, static variables are initialized to zero.
