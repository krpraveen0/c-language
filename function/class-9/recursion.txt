Recursion:
----------------
Generally we have two approach to write repetitive algorithms.
    1.) use of loops.
    2.) use Recursion.

Recursion:
Recursion is a repetitive process in which a function calls itself.


Recursive function:
----------------------
It is a function which contains call to itself.

Recursive function allows us to divide a complex problems into identical single simple cases which can 
be handled easily.
This is also well programming technique divide and conquer algorithm.

NOte:
A Recursive function must have at least one exit condition that can be satisfied. Otherwise 
Recursive function will call itself repeatedly until the runtime stack overflow.

Implementing Recursion:
1.) Decompose a problem into smaller problems of same type.
2.) Recursive calls must diminish(reduce) problem size.
3.) Necessity of base case(it is very important). it acts as a terminating condition.
