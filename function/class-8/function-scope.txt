Function Scope:
----------------------
Scope:
It determines the region of the program in which a definied object is visible. 
Scope pertains to any object that can be declared, such as variables or a function declarations.

In c language there are two scopes:
 1. Local Scope.
 2. Global Scope.

1. Local Scope(Local Variables):
-----------------------------------
The variables that can be declared inside a function are called Local variables.
Local variables are not visible outside of their own code block.
Local variables are accessible only while the block of code in which they are declared is executed.
The memory of the Local variables are created upon the entry into its block and destroyed upon exit.
The same name can be given to Different local variables in Different functions or blocks of the same program 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Program to illustrate the properties of local variables

#include<stdio.h>
void localVar();
//global variable
int b = 20;

void main(){
    int a;
    a = 15;
    printf("%d local to main",a);
    printf("%d local to locaVAr",b);
    localVar();
    
}

void localVar(){
        //local variable of localVar function
        // int b = 10;
        printf("%d local to localVar",b);

    }

Global Variables:
---------------------
A variable definied outside of all functions in a c program is known as Global variable.

The best and common practice is to define the global variable at the beginning of the program before any function.

Global variable may, however be placed any where in the program, prior to their first use, provided
they are defined outside of the function.

//By using the local and global variable write a program in c .
