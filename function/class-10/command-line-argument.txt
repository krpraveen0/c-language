Command line argument
------------------------
In C language if the main() has parameters, they are known as command-line argument.
These command line arguments allows the user to specify additional information when program is invoked(called)
by the compiler/system.

main():
----------
The main() can be defined either 
with no argument ie main() or main(void)
with two arguments: one integer and other an array of pointers to char(strings) that represent 
user-determined values to be passed to main().

The two different formats of main() are as;

1) 

int main(void){
    //local variables
    //statements
}

2) 
int main(int argc,char *argv[]){
    //local variables

    //statements

}

IN above the name of the arguments are of our choice but traditionally they are called
argc(argument count) and argv(argument vector).
Here the first argument(argc) defines the number of elements in the array identified in the second argument(char *argv[]).
The value of this argument is not entered using the keyboard, but the system determines it from the 
arguments the user types.

The argv array has several elements in that the first element points to the name of the program(its filename)
It is provided automatically by the program.
The last element of argv[] contains NULL and may be used to identify the end of the list.

The rest of the elements of argv[] contains pointers to the user-entered string values.
