Important points of functions in c language:
1.) functions in c must be declared and defined.
2.) functions declaration must be done before the function call which can be defined later.
3.) The declaration of the function contains
    a) function name.
    b) the return type of the function.
    c) the type and the order of the formal parameter.

Note: In other word declaration of the function contains the header of the function definition with semicolon at the end.

function definition which is traditionally coded after the function that make the call, contains the 
code needed to complete the task.

#include<stdio.h>
//function declaration
void greeting(void);

//main function
int main(void){
    //statements
    greeting();//call
    return 0;
}

//defining the function

void greeting(void){
    printf("hello c");
}
