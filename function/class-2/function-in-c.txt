The idea of top-down design in C language is done by using functions.
A c program is made up of one or more functions, in which atmost one  must be named with main.
The execution of program always starts and ends with main function only, but inside this main function
we can also call some other functions to do special tasks.

For example writing a calculator program

---------------------------------------------
calculator.C
---------------------------------------------
#include<stdio.h>

void main(){
    //call addition
    add();/adds two number
    //calling subtraction
    sub();//subtracts two numbers.
    //calling multiplication
    mult();//multiplies two numbers.

}
//defining addition function
add(){
 int num1, num2, sum;
 sum = num1 + num2;
 return sum;
}

//defining subtraction function
sub(){

}

//defining multiplication function
mult(){

}

A function in c language (including main) is an independent module that will be called to do a specific task.

Note:
A called function always receives control from the calling function.
When the called function completes its task, it returns control back to the calling function.
It may or may not return a value to the caller function.
The main function is called by the operating system, and main inturn calls the all other functions.
When the main function is completed then it returns control to the operating system.


Why to use function ?

Different advantages to use the function in c programming language.
1) By the use of function we can distribute the problems into uderstandable and manageable steps.
2) function avoid repeating the code in program. Once we define a function then we pack a group of code with a 
special name (function name) which allows the code to be executed from several locations in a program simply
by calling that function name at different places of need.
3) function provides code resusability.
4) Function can be used to protect the data. ie the data defined inside the function is available only if it 
is being executed (called).
5) A big project in c can be divided in different function which can be developed by the different developers
in this we can divide the workload of the large project also.

C language has two types of functions
1. Library functions (eg: printf(), scanf(), puts(), gets(), etc)
2. user defined functions(add(), subt(), mult() etc)
