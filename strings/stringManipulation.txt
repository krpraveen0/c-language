In C language string is not standard data type.
We cannot use it directly with most of C operators.
let us consider str1 and str2 are strings, so a program containing those two strings
    1.) we cannot assign one string to another string ie ( we cannot do str1 = str2).
    2.) we cannot compare for collating sequence ie s1<s2,s1>s2, s1>=s2 etc.
    3.) We cannot concatenate them to form a single longer string ie str1 + str2.

C language has a set of functions which are defined in <stdio.h> library which provide support for above operations
Here some of the useful functions defined in <stdio.h> are as follows:
1) strlen() :
    It returns the length of a string, specified as the number of characters in the string but 
    excluding the null character(\0).
    It the string is empty then it is going to return 0.

2)String Copy function:
    C has two string copy functions. 
        a.) strcpy() --> It copies the contents of one string to another. It copies the null character as well
        b.) strncpy() --> It also copies the contents of one string to another but it sets maximum number   
                          ofo characters that can be moved.

3)strrev() - String Reverse:
-----------------------------
    It is used to reverse the given string & the reversed string will be placed at the same location.

4)String Comparison:
------------------------------
C language has two string compare function:
    1) strcmp() -> It compares two strings until unequal characters are found or until the end of the strings is reached.
    2) strncmp() --> It compares untill unequal character are found, a specified number of characters have been tested, or
                    until end of the string is reached.
